# All the details about login and other credentials are situated in the project.txt file

# The database backup file is called AarhusWebDev.bacpac

# We have observed that the first time you run the project, it will throw an error about not having created the Homepage view (at least that was the error we got).
# In order to make it work, we have changed the connection string to another existing database from Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and then back to the one that was imported from the .bacpac file
